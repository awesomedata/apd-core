description:  A high-density electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from a sample of 42 healthy young adults while they performed three cognitive tasks; (1) an extended Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT+) with control, Simon, Flanker, and multi-source interference trials; (2) a 3-stimuli oddball task with frequent standard, rare target, and rare distractor stimuli; (3) a control, simple reaction task (SRT); and additionally (4) a resting-state protocol (REST). Basic demographic and psychometric information are included within the dataset (including The Amsterdam Resting-state Questionnaire (ARSQ) and UWIST Mood Adjective Check List questionnaires).
