category: EarthScience
description: This dataset contains 4148 simulation results, i.e., 4148 pairs of predictor/target. bkt.npy contains the breakthrough curves from all 6 injection wells recorded at the pumping well. pz.npy contains the 2D coordinates of the backtracked particles' end points, used to delineate the WHPA.
