description: The AEPM provides a graphic dashboard view of productivity and economic trends, and the data are presented as both by per-worker labor productivity and per-hour labor productivity, in addition to total factor productivity growth rates. Labor productivity growth has been computed for key sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing, wholesale and retail, transportation, and communication. Data on other economic parameters including output, capital, demand, income, population, and prices are also available as one-point references on the AEPM. The database offers both GDP data by industry and economy-wide input and output data with detailed disaggregation. This comprehensive dataset is one of the key elements of the APO Productivity Database 2020.
